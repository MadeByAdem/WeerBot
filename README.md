# Dutch Weather Telegram bot

This project is an addition to my Nest Project, but works as a standalone as well. Simply remove the functions you don't want. In essence it retrieves several weather data and sends it to your Telegram account. It also stores the data in a JSON file and sends it to another server (in my case where my Nest Project is hosted).

## Features
### Interactive Commands:
- /start - Initiates the bot and provides a welcome message.
- /menu - Displays the menu with available weather options.
- Weather Summaries: Provides a concise summary of current weather conditions, including temperature, wind speed, and a brief description.
- Detailed Weather Information: Offers detailed weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind direction and speed, UV index, sunrise and sunset times, and forecasts for today and tomorrow.
- Authorized Access: Ensures that only authorized users can access the botâ€™s functionalities.
- Automatic Logging: Logs weather data twice per hour and more detailed data a few times per day.
- Weather Data Retrieval: Fetches weather data from the KNMI API and handles potential errors and retries.
- UV Data Retrieval: Obtains UV index data from the OpenUV API, with support for both primary and backup API keys.
- Data Processing: Processes raw weather and UV data to create user-friendly summaries and detailed reports.
- Data Transmission: Securely transmits weather data to a designated server using SCP.
- Scheduled Updates: Supports scheduling of regular weather updates using the schedule module.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MadeByAdem/WeerBot
    cd archive_bot
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up your environment variables:**

    Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and variables with your keys.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

5. **Run the bot:**
    ```bash
    python weather_bot.py
    ```

### Setting up as a Systemd Service

1. **Modify the service files:**

    Update the `weather_bot.service` file with your actual paths:
    ```ini
    [Unit]
    Description=Weather Bot
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    ExecStart=/your/path/to/weather_bot/venv/bin/python /your/path/to/weather_bot/weather_bot.py
    WorkingDirectory=/your/path/to/weather_bot
    User=root
    Restart=always

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

    Update the `weather_update.service` file with your actual paths:
    ```ini
    [Unit]
    Description=Weather Update
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    ExecStart=/your/path/to/weather_bot/venv/bin/python /your/path/to/weather_bot/weather_update.py
    WorkingDirectory=/your/path/to/weather_bot
    User=root
    Restart=always

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

2. **Copy the service file to systemd:**
    ```bash
    sudo cp weather_bot.service /etc/systemd/system/
    sudo cp weather_update.service /etc/systemd/system/
    ```

3. **Reload systemd and start the service:**
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl start weather_bot.service
    sudo systemctl start weather_update.service
    ```

4. **Enable the service to start on boot:**
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable weather_bot.service
    sudo systemctl enable weather_update.service
    ```
